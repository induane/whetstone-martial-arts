Cost & Payment
==============

Trial Period
------------

All potential students are encouraged to attend classes for a couple weeks to see if they enjoy it. Martial
arts is NOT for everybody; we work hard on both technique and physical fitness.

There is no charge for the two-week trial period.

Monthly Dues
------------

Montly cost: $100

There is a household discount; additional students from the same household are $50 per month. So two students
from the same household is $150 per month; and three students is $200 a month.

Payment
-------

I take Venmo, cash, or even an IOU. Payments are due around the end of the month.

Equipment Included
------------------

Enrollment includes a pair of nunchaks, a training knife (plastic resin, not sharp), and Kali Sticks (wooden
sticks made from Rattan).

Once a student completes their trial period and decides to continue with classes, the additional equipment is
ordered - one each month. First month, nunchaks, second month, training knife, and third month Kali Sticks. The
equipment is paid for with class dues and does not cost extra.

.. note:: The rattan sticks are ordered from the Philippines and often take substantial time to arrive. Once they are received we set aside time to "decorate" them - this entails sanding, burning, and sometimes a laser.

Additional Equipment
--------------------

Uniforms must be paid for separately. The current cost of uniforms is $100 per student; they are not required to be purchased
immediately but need to be acquired before competition in tournaments.

A student will need to acquire:

- A pair of knuckle gloves (punching bag gloves with open fingers)
- Mouth guard
- Sparring helmet
- Sparring footgear
- Sparring body armor

We have some house-equipment that can be borrowed during sparring practices, however it is generally preferable to acquire your own.
